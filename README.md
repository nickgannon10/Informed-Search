# Informed-Search

A couple points of emphasis: <br />
1. Execution: A list of consecutive integers is required to interface with the two search models presented. To play around with the two attached python files, input different possible pancake stack lists into the fourth line from the bottom in each of the python files.  <br />

2. The A* algorithm is a depth first search algorithm. The code consists of a node class (initializing the cost function and state), a priority class (establishing the selection process for the successor node), and the A* algorithm class (which ultimately ties everything together, execute, and displays the algorithm results.  <br />

3.  The uniform cost algorithm and the A* algorithm are remarkably similar. The total cost function for A* accounts for both forward and backward cost, whereas the total cost function for Uniform cost only accounts for backwards cost. The uninformed search algorithm will lead to the same outcome, but it will not arrive at those outcomes as quickly as it lacks the heuristic function.  <br />
